### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Mason Lane. You may know me by my alias' Lane203m or aWink-ofSleep! I am a Junior software developer, and I'm looking for opportunities in Vancouver or Ontario! I have a degree in software systems engineering, and a strong working understanding of

My goal is to reach intermediate level in my next position, and apply to the province's (BC/ON) p.eng program. I have three years of software development experience and have worked extensively with React as a frontend developer.

I also have experience in fullstack development - which has allowed me to hone my skills in other areas as I grow into a deeper specialization. Over-all, I consider myself a very well rounded junior developer who's ready to specialize in a specific area. I am adept at object oriented programming and data structures, and am a capable all-round developer.

Regarding my experience in video game development; much of it has been on personal time, or university classes. These include Game Jams, HTML5 games, and Unity projects. See my latest work on Itch.io! I have also worked with cross-platform VR development on Unity; You can see some of the work Iâ€™ve done in VR on my Github page and Youtube channel.  
 
I enjoy an eclectic range of hobbies which includes playing Cello, personal projects on the Adobe Suite, Gaming, and software development.
